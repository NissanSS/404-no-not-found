Small my own made project for Valentines day.

This is a playful, interactive Valentine-style web page built around a simple choice: YES or NO. When the user clicks NO, the button moves to different positions on the screen, changes its text, and gradually shrinks, while the YES button grows larger. At the same time, images update to add humor and emotion to the interaction.

After several attempts, the NO button disappears entirely, leaving only the YES option.
